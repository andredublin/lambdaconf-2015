# Functional Programming
### It's all about functions.

---

# Function Definition

```haskell
data Food = Eggs | Coffee

data Happiness = Happy | Neutral | Unhappy

john :: Food -> Happiness
john Eggs   = Unhappy
john Coffee = Happy
```

--- 

# Function Application

```haskell
> john Eggs

Unhappy
```

```haskell
> john Coffee

Happy
```
---
# The Real Deal

1. **Totality**. Every element in *domain* must be mapped to some element in *codomain*.
2. **Determinism**. Applying a function with the same value (in domain) results in same value (in codomain).

---

# Exercises

```haskell
superpower :: CharacterClass -> Superpower

weakness :: Superpower -> Kryptonite
```

1. Create a set called `CharacterClass`, which represents the different types of characters.
2. Create a set called `Superpower`, which represents different superpowers.
3. Create a set called `Kryptonite`, which represents different weaknesses for characters.
4. Create the above functions `superpower` and `weakness`, and apply them at various elements in their domain.

---

# Types
### Sets of values.

---

# Literal Types

 * `String` : The set that contains all strings; `"foo"` is an element of this set.
 * `Number` : The set that contains all numbers;[^0] `5.5` is an element of this set.
 * `Boolean` : The set that contains the values `true` and `false`.

[^0]: Not really, $%#@&!!

# Product Types[^1]

```haskell
data Loc = Loc Number Number
```

[^1]: They get their name from an easy way you can use to compute the size of these sets (hint: product = multiplication).

---

# Product Types

```haskell
  data Loc = Loc Number Number
--      |
--      |
--      |
--  The name of 
--   the type.   
```

---

# Product Types

```haskell
  data Loc = Loc Number Number
--            |
--            |
--            |            
-- The name of a function
-- that will create values
-- of the type. AKA the 
--     constructor!
```

---

# Product Types

```haskell
  data Loc = Loc Number Number
--                 \      /
--                  \    /
--                   \  /
--                    \/          
--       Constructor parameters (types).
```

---

# Product Types

```haskell
data Loc = Loc Number Number

whereAmI = Loc 1 2
```

---

# Product Types
### What's the opposite of *con*struction?[^4]

```haskell
locX :: Loc -> Number
locX (Loc x _) = x

locY :: Loc -> Number
locY (Loc _ y) = y

locX (Loc 1 2) -- 1
locY (Loc 1 2) -- 2
```

[^4]: *De*construction, of course! AKA *pattern matching*.

---

# Product Types
### Another way to deconstruct.

```haskell
locX :: Loc -> Number
locX l = case l of 
           (Loc x _) -> x
```

---

# Exercises

1. Create a `CharacterStats` product type to model some character statistics in an role-playing game (e.g. health, strength, etc.).
2. Create some values of that type to understand how to use data constructors.
3. Use pattern matching to extract individual components out of the data type.

---

# Coproduct Types
### (AKA 'Sum' Types)[^2]

```haskell
data NPC =
  Ogre String Loc Number | 
  Wolf String Loc Number 
```

[^2]: They get their name from an easy way you can use to compute the size of these sets (hint: sum = addition).

---

# Coproduct Types

```haskell
-- The name of
--  the type
--     |
--     |
  data NPC =
    Ogre String Loc Number | 
    Wolf String Loc Number 
```

---

# Coproduct Types

```haskell
  data NPC =
    Ogre String Loc Number | 
    Wolf String Loc Number 
--   |
--   |
-- Data constructor.  
```
---

# Coproduct Types

```haskell
  data NPC =
    Ogre String Loc Number | 
    Wolf String Loc Number 
--          |    |    |
--           \   |   /
--             \ | /
--   Constructor parameters (types).
```
---

# Coproduct Types
### Destruction / pattern matching.

```haskell
nameOf :: NPC -> String
nameOf (Ogre name _ _) = name
nameOf (Wolf name _ _) = name
```
---

# Coproduct Types
### Deconstruction / pattern matching.

```haskell
data NPC =
  Ogre String Loc Number | 
  Wolf String Loc Number 

nameOf :: NPC -> String
nameOf npc = case npc of 
               (Ogre name _ _) -> name
               (Wolf name _ _) -> name
```

---

# Exercises

1. Create a `Monster` sum type to represent different types of monsters in a game. Make sure they share at least one common piece of information (e.g. `health` or `name`).
2. Create a few monsters of varying types.
3. Create a function to extract out a piece of information common to all constructors.

---

# Record Types[^5]

```haskell
data NPC =
  Ogre {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number} |
  Wolf {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number}
```

[^5]: Record types are represented using native Javascript objects.

---
# Record Types

```haskell
  data NPC =
    Ogre {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number} |
    Wolf {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number}
--       |                                            |
--       \----------------------|---------------------/
--                              |
--                         Record type.
```

---

# Record Types

```haskell
  data NPC =
    Ogre {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number} |
    Wolf {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number}
--        |                                          |
--        \--------------------|---------------------/
--                             |
--                      A 'row' of types.  
```

---

# Record Types

```haskell
  data NPC =
    Ogre {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number} |
    Wolf {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number}
--         |
--      A label.
```

---

# Record Types

```haskell
  data NPC =
    Ogre {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number} |
    Wolf {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number}
--                  |
--        The type of the label.
```

---

# Record Types
### Construction / deconstruction.

```haskell
makeWolf :: String -> Loc -> Number -> NPC
makeWolf name loc health = Wolf {name: name, loc: loc, health: health}

nameOf :: NPC -> String
nameOf (Ogre { name : n }) = n
nameOf (Wolf { name : n }) = n
```

---

# Record Types
### The dot operator.

```haskell
nameOf :: NPC -> String
nameOf (Ogre record) = record.name
nameOf (Wolf record) = record.name
```

---

# Record Types
### 'Updating' records.

```haskell
changeName :: NPC -> NPC
changeName (Ogre r) = Ogre r { name = "Shrek" }
changeName (Wolf r) = Wolf r { name = "Big Bad" }
```

---

# Record Types
### Magic record syntax stuff.

```haskell
(_ { name = "Shrek" }) // Function from record to updated record

record { name = _ }    // Function from string to updated `record`

_ { name = _ }         // Guess? :-)

```

---

# Exercises

1. Rework some of your early product types to use records.
2. Create another class called `InventoryItem` whose constructor takes a record that has fields relevant to items that a player can carry with her.

---

# Basic Function Types

```haskell
data Monster = Giant | Alien
data FavoriteFood = Humans | Kittens

fave :: Monster -> FavoriteFood
fave Giant = Humans
fave Alien = Kittens
```

---

# Basic Function Types
### Lambdas AKA closures AKA anonymous functions AKA arrow functions AKA...

```haskell
fave :: Monster -> FavoriteFood
fave = \monster -> ...
```

```javascript
var fave = function(monster) {
  ...
}
```

```javascript
// ECMAScript 6
var fave = monster => ...
```

---

# Exercises

1. Create a function from monster to total hit points (how much damage they can take before dying).
2. Express the same function as a lambda.
3. Apply the function at various inputs.

---

# Type Aliases
### What's in a name?

```haskell
type CharData =
  {name :: String, loc :: Loc, health :: Number}

data NPC = Ogre CharData | Wolf CharData
```

---

# Newtypes
### Wrappers without the overhead.


```haskell
newtype Health = Health Number

dead = Health 0
```

---

# Newtypes
### Deconstruction / pattern matching.

```haskell
newtype Health = Health Number

isAlive :: Health -> Boolean
isAlive (Health v) = v > 0

isAlive h = case h of
              Health v -> v > 0
```

---

# Exercises

1. Create a type alias for a record called `MagicalItemRec` which has several fields.
2. Use the type alias to define a `newtype` called `MagicalItem`, whose constructor is called `MagicalItem`.
3. Create some values of type `MagicalItem`.
4. Create a few functions to extract out the fields of `MagicalItem`.

---

# Higher-Order Functions
### Or, OMG sets can hold functions!!!

---

# Higher-Order Functions
### Functions that accept functions.

```haskell
likesEmptyString :: (String -> Boolean) -> Boolean
likesEmptyString f = f ""
```

---

# Higher-Order Functions
### Functions that return functions.

```haskell
matches :: String -> (String -> Boolean)
matches v = \text -> text == v

matchesEvil = matches "evil"

matchesEvil "john" -- false
matchesEvil "evil" -- true
```

---

# Higher-Order Functions
### "Multi-parameter" functions.[^6]

```haskell
damageNpc :: Number -> (NPC -> NPC)
damageNpc damage = \npc -> ...
```

[^6]: Not *really*, of course: functions in PureScript are always functions *from* one set *to* another set.

--- 


# Higher-Order Functions
### Making sense of "multi-parameter" functions: values.

```haskell
f a b c d e

-- (((((f a) b) c) d) e)
```

--- 


# Higher-Order Functions
### Making sense of "multi-parameter" functions: types.

```haskell
f :: a -> b -> c -> d -> e

-- f :: (a -> (b -> (c -> (d -> e))))
```


---

# Higher-Order Functions
### MORE functions that return functions.

```haskell
damageNpc :: Number -> (NPC -> NPC)
damageNpc = \damage -> \npc -> ...
```

```haskell
damageNpc :: Number -> (NPC -> NPC)
damageNpc = \damage npc -> ...
```

```haskell
damageNpc :: Number -> (NPC -> NPC)
damageNpc damage = \npc -> ...
```

```haskell
damageNpc :: Number -> (NPC -> NPC)
damageNpc damage npc = ...
```

---

# Exercises

```haskell
damagerOf :: String -> (NPC -> NPC)

type Damager = Number -> NPC -> NPC
```

1. Create a function `damagerOf` that takes a name (`String`), and returns another function that damages an `NPC` but only if its name is equal to the specified name.
2. Create a function `boostDamage` which takes a `Damager` (defined above) and returns another `Damager` that boosts the damage done by the passed in damager by 10%.

# Parametric Polymorphism
### Para..what?

---

# Polymorphic Data
### Type constructors: data with "holes".

```haskell
data Map4x4 a = Map4x4 a a a a
			           a a a a
			           a a a a
			           a a a a
			           
boolMap4x4 = Map4x4 true  true  false true 
                    false true  true  true 
                    false false false true 
                    true  false false true
```

---

# Polymorphic Data
### Type-level functions.

```haskell

-- invalid :: Map4x4 

valid :: Map4x4 Boolean
```

## The type constructor `Map4x4` is a function whose domain is the set of all types, and whose codomain is a family of `Map4x4 a` types.

--- 

# Polymorphic Functions
### Or, OMG sets can hold sets!!!

--- 

# Polymorphic Functions
### The heart of functional abstraction.

```haskell
upperLeft :: forall a. Map4x4 a -> a
upperLeft v _ _ _ 
          _ _ _ _
          _ _ _ _ 
          _ _ _ _ = v
```

--- 

# Polymorphic Functions
### How to read these crazy signatures.

```haskell
upperLeft :: forall a. Map4x4 a -> a

-- (a :: Type) -> Map4x4 a -> a
```

---

# Exercises

```haskell
data TreasureChest a = ???

isEmpty :: ???
```

1. Create a polymorphic `TreasureChest` sum type that can either contain any type of thing, or be empty.
2. Create a polymorphic function that determines whether or not any treasure chest is empty.

# Extensible Rows
### Like duck typing only better.

```haskell
type Point r = { x :: Number, y :: Number | r }
```

---

# Extensible Rows
### Like duck typing only better.

```haskell
type Point r = { x :: Number, y :: Number | r }
--         |                              |
--         |                              |
--    'remainder'        syntax that means "the rest of the row"

gimmeX :: forall r. Point r -> Number
gimmeX p = p.x

gimmeX {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3} -- 1 - works!

-- gimmeX {x: 1, z: 3}    -- Invalid, no x!
```

---

# Exercises

```haskell
type NonPlayerCharacterRec = ???
type ItemRec = ???
type PlayerCharacterRec = ???

getName :: ???
getName r = r.name
```

1. Create records for `NonPlayerCharacter`, `Item`, and `PlayerCharacter` that all share at least one field (`name`?).
2. Create a function that extracts a name from any record which has *at least* a `name` field of type `String`.

---

# Kinds
### Categories of sets.

---

# `*`

### The name for the category of *sets of values*.
### (AKA *Type*)

Includes things like:

 * `CharacterClass` 
 * `Superpower`
 * `String`

---

# `* -> *`
### The name for the category of *type-level functions*.
### (AKA Higher-Kinded Type / Type Constructor)

---

# `* -> *`

```haskell
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

---

# `* -> *`
### Type constructors are just (math) functions!


```haskell
addOne :: Number -> Number
addOne n = n + 1

List :: * -> *
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
```

---

# `* -> * -> *`
### Turtles all the way down.

```
Map :: * -> * -> *
data Map k v = ...
```


---
# `(* -> *) -> *`
### More turtles.

```haskell
Container :: (* -> *) -> *
data Container f = {create :: forall a. a -> f a}

list :: Container List
list = Container {create: \a -> Cons a Nil}
```

---

# `* -> * -> * -> * -> * -> *`
### Reading type constructors.

```haskell
foo :: f a b c d e

-- (((((f a) b) c) d) e)
```

---

# `!`
### The name for the category of *sets of effects*.

```haskell
foreign import data DOM :: !
```

---

# `# !`
### The name for the category of *rows of effects*.

```haskell
-- Supply a row of effects and a type, 
-- and get back another type:
foreign import data Eff :: # ! -> * -> *

trace :: forall r. String -> Eff (trace :: Trace | r) Unit
```

---

# `# *`
### The name for the category of *rows of types*.

```haskell
-- Supply a row of types, get back another type:
foreign import data Object :: # * -> *
```

---

# Foreign Types[^7]

```haskell
foreign import data jQuery :: *
```

[^7]: THERE BE DRAGONZ HERE!!!

---

# FP Toolbox
### Stuff you couldn't escape even if you wanted to.


---

# FP Toolbox
### Maybe it's there, maybe it's not?[^8]

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

type Player = 
  { armour :: Maybe Armor }
```

[^8]: AKA `null`, the FP way.

---

# FP Toolbox
### List: the ultimate FP data structure.

```haskell
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
--                       |    |
--                     head   |
--                          tail

oneTwoThree = Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Nil))
```

---

# FP Toolbox
### `Either` it's this or it's that.

```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

type Player = 
  { rightHand :: Either Weapon Shield }
```

---

# FP Toolbox
### `Tuple`, the opposite of `Either`.[^9]

```haskell
data Tuple a b = Tuple a b
--                     | |
--                 first second
I
type Player = 
  { wrists :: Tuple (Maybe Bracelet) (Maybe Bracelet) }
```

[^9]: AKA sometimes it's just too damn hard to name stuff!

---

# FP Toolbox
### Native Javascript arrays.

```haskell
[1, 2, 3] :: [Number]
```

---

# Exercises

1. Use *all* the data structures you've learned about (`Maybe`, `Either`, `Tuple`, and `[]`) to build a representation of character state called `CharacterState`.
2. Define a few functions to extract some information out of the data structure.

---

# Type Classes
### Generic interfaces, the FP way.

---

# Type Classes
### Generic interfaces in Java.

```java
public interface Appendable<A> {
  public A append(A a1, A a2);
}
class AppendableNumber extends Appendable<Float> {
  public Float append(Float a1, Float a2) {
    return a1 + a2;
  }
}
Appendable<Float> appendableNumber = new AppendableNumber();
appendableNumber.append(1, 2); // 3!
```

---

# Type Classes
### Generic 'interfaces' in Javascript.

```javascript
function makeAppendable(append) {
  return {
    append: append
  };
}

var boolAppendable = makeAppendable(
  function(v1, v2) {
    return v1 && v2;
  }
);

boolAppendable.append(true, false); // false!
```

---

# Type Classes
### Generic interfaces in PureScript.

```haskell
class Appendable a where
  append :: a -> a -> a
  
instance appendableNumber :: Appendable Number where
  append a1 a2 = a1 + a2

append 1 2 -- 3!
```

---

# Type Classes
### Turbocharged polymorphism.

```haskell
repeat :: forall a. (Appendable a) => Number -> a -> a
repeat 0 a = a 
repeat n a = append (repeat (n - 1) a) a
             
sort :: forall a. (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]

-- etc.
```

---

# Type Classes
### Hierarchies: like OO inheritance, but not.

```haskell
class Eq a where
  equals :: a -> a -> Boolean

data Ordering = LT | GT | EQ

class (Eq a) <= Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
```

---

# Type Classes
### Hierarchies: like OO inheritance, but not.

```haskell
class (Eq a) <= Ord a where
--       |
--       |
-- The superclass.
--
-- Read: "Ord a implies Eq a"
```

---

# Exercises

```haskell
class Describable a where
  describe :: a -> String
  
data Weapon = Sword | Spear

instance describableWeapon :: ???
```

1. Create an instance of `Describable` for `Weapon`.
2. Create instances of `Eq` (the equal type class) for some of the data types you created.

---

# Effects
### Or, how to get in trouble *fast*.

---

```haskell
import Debug.Trace

main = trace "Hello World!"
```

---


```haskell
import Debug.Trace

main = do
  trace "Hello World!"
  
  trace "Bye World!"
```

---

# Exercises

1. Import `Debug.Trace` and make your very own 'Hello World' program.

# Scary Sounding Things
### Monadic zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms... 

## WTF?!?!!

---

# Scary Sounding Things
### Let's play a game: give your friend a birthday present that she'll adore.

---

# Scary Sounding Things
### The rules of the game.

**Rule 1**: If something is inside a box, you may change it to anything else and the result will still be inside the box.

**Rule 2**: If something is not inside a box, you can pack it into a box.

**Rule 3**: If something is packed inside a box which is packed inside another box, you can replace that with a single box containing that thing.

---

# Scary Sounding Things
### Your inventory.

**Item 1**: You have Ripley, a Chihuaha mutt who can magically change a lump of coal into a beautiful present that your friend will like.

**Item 2**: You have a box containing a box containing a lump of coal.

Which rules should you apply to create a birthday present your friend will adore???

---

# Scary Sounding Things
### The rules of the game, redux.

**Rule 1**: If something is inside a box, you may change it to anything else and the result will still be inside the box. 
`(a -> b) -> f a -> f b`

**Rule 2**: If something is not inside a box, you can pack it into a box.
`a -> f a`

**Rule 3**: If something is packed inside a box which is packed inside another box, you can replace that with a single box containing that thing.
`f (f a) -> f a`

---

# Scary Sounding Things
### The rules of the game, redux redux.

```haskell
fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b -- AKA (<$>)

pure :: a -> f a               -- AKA return

join :: f (f a) -> f a

-- bind AKA (>>=) = \fa f -> join (fmap f fa)
```

---

# OMG a **monad**, run in terror!!!!!

---

# Nah, just kidding
## Scary sounding things give you **rewrite rules** you can use to **manipulate the types** into the form you require.

---

# The scary sounding names **don't matter** at all

---

# Exercises

```haskell
class Evitacilppa f where
  erup :: forall a. a -> f a
  
  pa :: forall a b. f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

1. You are given `f Number` and `Number`, for some `Evitacilppa f`. If you have a function:

   `add :: Number -> Number -> Number`

   which "rewrite rules" do you need to use so that you can apply the `add` function to the two numbers?

---

# Let's Build a Game!
### Enough math already plz!!!

---

# The Soul of an RPG
### Or the types, anyway.

```haskell
type Game s i = {
  initial  :: s,
  describe :: s -> String,
  parse    :: String -> Either String i,
  update   :: s -> i -> Either String s }

runGame :: forall s i. Game s i -> Eff (game :: GAME) Unit
runGame g = ...
```
